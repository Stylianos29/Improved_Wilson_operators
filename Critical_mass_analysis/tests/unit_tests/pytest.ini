markers =
    input_values_exception_raised_test: testing whether a function/method raises appropriate exceptions for input values out of range or of incorrect type. Ideally all functions/methods taking arguments, regardless private or not, must be tested.
    output_values_replication_test: testing whether the output of a function/method can be replicated partially or in its entirety by a constant or an expression. Ideally all functions/methods in a module must be tested.
    property_based_test: testing whether a specific property such as a mathematical identity or relation is satisfied by a number of functions/methods, if there is one.
