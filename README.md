# Improved_Wilson_operators

A Python-based project for implementing improved versions of the Wilson Dirac
operator in Lattice QCD for the simple U(1) case. Redefining the (standard)
Wilson operator in this context primarily involves reimplementing the
derivatives and the Laplacian, not so much for improved performance and
accuracy, but to enable the discretized QCD theory to better approximate the
features of the continuum theory. The project leverages mpi4py for parallel
processing on HPC clusters and supports both data processing and post-processing
analysis of the generated files.
